Tesla Cybertruck in Three.js
----------------------------
Well, I was going to draw this in CSS until I learned it already has been done too many times. So instead, I used Three.js. Nevertheless, my goal was to replicate as many of the truckâ€™s details as possible based on available Internet photos.

Now concerning the truck speed, 1 length unit in Three.js represents 10", so 1 mile = 6,336 units (for 63,360").
